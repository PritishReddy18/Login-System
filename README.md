# Simple Python Login System

This project is a simple, standalone user login and registration system built entirely in Python. It was one of my first projects, created to practice and understand the fundamentals of user input, file handling, and basic credential management without relying on any external frameworks like Django.

## 🚀 Features

* **User Registration:** Allows new users to create an account by providing a username and password.
* **User Login:** Authenticates existing users against their saved credentials.
* **Persistent Storage:** This system securely saves user credentials to a file. This allows users to log in again at any time across different sessions without needing to sign up again.
* **No Dependencies:** Built with pure, vanilla Python.

## 🏃 How to Run

1.  Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2.  Download or clone the `Login-System.py` (or your file's name) to your local machine.
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5.  Run the script with the following command:
6.  ```bash
    python Login-System.py
    ```
7.  Follow the on-screen prompts to either **Sign Up** (to create a new account) or **Login** (to access an existing one).
